# hamburger-sandwich

Let's eat!

let's also work on our routing, handlebars, and logic :)

Done and done and done!

This application uses express, node, mysql, and a non-sequelize ORM (much to my chagrin)

Deployed on heroku for all to experience, the user can add burgers to the menu, and move them to the devoured column, order them again, or delete them. This of course uses the CRUD method, more specifically: post, put, and destroy.
